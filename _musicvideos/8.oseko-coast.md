desc: In the music video for “Coast”, Oseko showcases his home and stomping grounds.<br><br>We float along for the ride, feeling the pulse of the quintessential Ontario bedroom community through the eyes of one of it’s resident artists.<br><br>Fun fact - during the shots of Oseko running through the rain, a tornado touched down a few blocks away. No word of a lie.<br>(if only we could have shot it).
