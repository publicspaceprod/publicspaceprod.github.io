desc: In the music video for “Holland” we set out to create a loop that relentlessly pushes, pulls, and tears us down. In this loop, we are The Awoken and The Caregiver.<br><br>With the support of a MuchFact grant (RIP) we were able to create a tormented world to be shattered by a deliberate and remorseless break.
