desc: Stripped down and pulpy- not always the combo you want. In the music video for “My Way” by Oseko, however, this pair was precisely what we were after.<br><br>Inspired by numerous videos that engulf the viewer in a small scope world, we set out to make a signature video that would do just that. Lacking many frills, we are left to enter into Oseko’s visual psyche.
