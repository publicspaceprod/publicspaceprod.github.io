title:  "Peaceful Ghosts"
subtitle: "Epoch Tapes"
details: Dir. Kyle Marchen
desc: This video features intimate moments with a man in turmoil.<br><br>Through abstract imagery, we see the push and pull of a visceral struggle to overcome and move outwards. These themes tie into the tone set by the beautiful track, “Peaceful Ghosts”.<br><br>Our main goal was to create an emotion instead of a rigid narrative. That’s why the level of ambiguity in the video is integral.
