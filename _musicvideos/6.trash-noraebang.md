subtitle: "Justin Trash"
details: Dir. Kyle Marchen
desc: The noraebang is a cultural symbol for Justin Trash. In the music video for “Noraebang” we look inside and drown in the atmosphere (and soju).<br><br>The video is set purely in and around a karaoke, where Justin and his crew (Uptown Boy Band) turn loose. An over saturated palette mirrors the video’s tone to a tee.<br><br>"The direct translation to 'Noraebang' is 'Karaoke room. It's a huge part of Asian culture that everybody experiences differently and [this video] is just showing everybody how I experience it."<br><br>- Justin Trash
